# Synthesize

Synthesize is an opinionated toolbox of utilities for Typescript. I mostly just use this for my own
projects; may not be useful to other people.

```
npm i @mhoc/synthesize
```

## Things Included

- re-exports `io-ts` (`import { io }`)
- re-exports `fp-ts` (`import { fp }`)
- utility `iodecode`: function to decode objects with an io-ts spec, in a procedural way
